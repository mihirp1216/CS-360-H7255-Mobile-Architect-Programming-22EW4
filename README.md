# •	Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

This program is an inventory tracker, and it is built to allow for user login as well as CRUD capabilities for data saved in SQLite databases for both user and event information, as per the specifications.

# •	What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

The app allows for user registration, login, and a forgot password option:

The primary function of the app as an inventory tracker allows a user to add, edit, and delete data, giving CRUD functionality between the user and the SQLite database housing the data:

# •	How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?

I followed coding best practices, kept the code structure simple to keep it clear and tidy, utilized logical naming conventions, and commented sections of code to describe what I was doing.

# •	How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?

Testing was carried out on a phone, with particular attention paid to UI design and structure, and adjustments were made in real time. With this strategy, I could utilize an actual phone to simulate a user and make minor UI and code changes to improve the user experience and make the app more visually attractive.

# •	Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

I had to make several adjustments to the app's UI in order to build something that I felt was better in accordance with the project's needs and aims. My first design developed as I gained a deeper understanding of the material and the app development process. This was especially true once I started using a physical phone, which allowed me to better appreciate the outcome from the user's perspective.

# •	In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

In my opinion, the login feature, as well as the ability to use saved user data in the SQLite database, was a success. It supports numerous users, correctly stored user data that can be accessed again, is not duplicated, and allows a user to obtain a password using more than one requesting form of data. This gives the app a sense of security while simultaneously making it more feature rich.
